# GIT ğŸ˜‚

Don't you think our commit messages are a bit too serious? Since I started
using `ğŸ˜‚` with my commit messages my life in the company became ~152% better ğŸ˜‚

Just look at these great examples how a simple `ğŸ˜‚` at the end can make
communication inside your team much more humane ğŸ˜‚

- closes #123 moved back button 6 pixels left ğŸ˜‚
- closes #172 changed header color ğŸ˜‚
- closes #422 fixed a possible memory leak when sharing handle between threads ğŸ˜‚

Start adding `ğŸ˜‚` to all your commit messages!

## Installing ğŸ˜‚

Just copy `hooks/commit-msg` from this repo to your local `.git/hooks/` and
enjoy ğŸ˜‚

## TODO ğŸ˜‚

Please contribute ğŸ˜‚

- JIRA plugin to add `ğŸ˜‚` to every ticket title and every comment.
- Slack plugin to add `ğŸ˜‚` to every message.
